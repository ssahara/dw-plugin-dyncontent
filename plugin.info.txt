desc   Text variables provide a way to insert text that can change depending on various factors, such as SERVER_ADDR and REMOTE_ADDR. They are replaced by JavaScript when the page loaded. You may define the replacement in the conf/userscript.js file as global object var TEXT_VARIABLES={%FOO%':'bar'};
